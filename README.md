# Craigslist Roommate Search Experiment
An experiment we are conducting to study what variables influence response rate when using the Craiglist roommate search feature.

We would like to give credit to fellow UC Berkeley student Ahsen Qamar for the initial experimental idea of the effect of gender on job application response rates, which we adapted into our present experiment.

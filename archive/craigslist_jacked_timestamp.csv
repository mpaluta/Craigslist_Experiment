I have a potty-trained and well-mannered pomsky on site - he is not allowed in the tenant's room. He does not bark or howl.
If I have an issue, I voice my opinion and compromise on resolutions. I respect tenants who voice their opinions as well. I tend to get along with everyone, so this is simply a disclosure.

Expectations:
Noise should be kept to a moderate level. I do not mind guests, so long as the neighbors do not complain.
This is my home as well as yours - please keep it clean and classy!
Communicate.
No hard drugs. I do not mind if you smoke outside or in the garage, but absolutely nothing inside.

Hello! I have a rental house in a not exactly ideal neighborhood in 
Indy, but its not too terrible.  No break ins or anything like that.  
I've accidentally left the doors unlocked dozens of times and it's been 
fine.  My boyfriend left me high and dry and I'm unable to pay all the 
rent and bills on my own.  I'm looking for a cool and friendly 
individual to split bills with.  You would have your own (small) room 
and a whole living room for your stuff.  Unfortunately there is only one
 bathroom so we would have to share that.  There is a big and secluded 
back yard which is a bonus.



I'm a 38 year old white female.  I have 2 kids who are with me Tuesdays 
and Thursdays for a few hours and Saturday for an overnight but we 
generally spend most of our time out of the house or hanging out with 
their dad who I am friendly with.  



I'm looking for someone cool and responsible enough to at least pay 
their share of the rent.  I am a pretty good roommate, clean and don't 
have wild parties or anything like that.  I would be ok with a male 
roommate as long as he is respectful and not gonna hit on me all the

I'm a 26 year old white male. Very easy going, laid back and drama free. Very clean and organized. I also have 1 small dog 🐶 she's just an older big baby. I have a 3 bedroom house right off of highway 37 on the southwest corner of greenwood, and looking for a roommate to help share the cost of living with. Bedrooms are not furnished, but rest of the house is. Hoping to find another male somewhere close to age anywhere from 18-about 30. But I'm flexible. Will also consider a female around the same age as well. I'm happy to share whatever I have with you, but you need to pitch in as well, and not just eat or drink whatever I have without providing also. I have Direct TV cable, and will pay for that, has hookup in bedrooms, living room, and basement. I don't have internet, but will consider getting it if you desire and can throw in on it. Have all appliances, and washer and dryer. I will also supply laundry detergent, fabric softener, and dryer sheets. Shared bathroom, but I'm very clean and keep everything clean always! Or you could have the entire basement to yourself. Has cable hookup, and shower in it, but no sink or toilet. It's not a brand new or perfect house, has its flaws, but very livable and cozy. I'm slowly working on improving it, and if you're willing to help then that's even better! Mainly just needs painted inside in every room. Which I almost have done now. I'm looking for $600 a month. That sounds like a lot, but it's really not considering it's a shared house, not just limited to one room, and that is everything included; rent, all utilities, power, heat, ac, cable, etc... I can try to work with you though, so just get with me and we can figure something out. Message or text for any other details! Please give info about yourself when you reply, like age, whether you have a job, vehicle, and can split cost, etc, and please send a picture so I know you're real and serious!

Each occupant is on a separate rental agreement. The common rooms are a living room, kitchen, laundry room, bathroom, half bathroom, and a utility room with a washer and dryer for use by occupants. Renter's insurance is included in the price. Utilities are paid by the landlord, including Internet access. If interested, ask about the option to use the Ethernet. Parking is available on the street as well as in back. Pets are generally not allowed (example of a possible exception is for fish kept in the half bathroom in a small container). Smoking and vaping of any sort are not allowed. Selected occupant must be neat, pass the screening process (including financial, and criminal and civil courts), be responsible, quiet and get along with others. The landlord, a futurist / environmentalist lives next door, and a techie/student, and factory worker live there. Gardeners, neighborly people, bicyclists, commuters by bus, people who like to live near Downtown, nonsmokers, and ecological minded people might especially appreciate this location. By the way, I know of landlords who rent bedrooms, studios, apartments and houses. Currently (01/27/2019) I know of bedrooms and a one bedroom apartment ($650) for rent.

Total for Rent and Utilities is 540.00 a month if you are a conscientious person and turn off lights, etc when not in the room, close doors and don't have the window open while air-conditioning or heat is running, etc. If not, then the 60.00 per month utility will be increased per month to compensate me for the additional electric bill amount as a result of your habits. Rent is due on the 1st of the month or you will have to pay a late fee of $35.00 per day. I'm not requiring a signed lease at this time just looking for someone who is professional and responsible. Each of us will need to agree to give the other a 30 day notice to vacate. I do require a security deposit.

I would prefer a female roommate too...No, I'm not a perv :) I am in a wonderful relationship!!! Just prefer, little more professional, little more clean lol!!!

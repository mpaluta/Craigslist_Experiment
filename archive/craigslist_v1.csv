About me:
I'm not a neat freak, but I am clean. I like my place to stay clean whenever possible.
I have a potty-trained and well-mannered pomsky on site - he is not allowed in the tenant's room. He does not bark or howl.
If I have an issue, I voice my opinion and compromise on resolutions. I respect tenants who voice their opinions as well. I tend to get along with everyone, so this is simply a disclosure.

Expectations:
Noise should be kept to a moderate level. I do not mind guests, so long as the neighbors do not complain.
This is my home as well as yours - please keep it clean and classy!
Communicate.
No hard drugs. I do not mind if you smoke outside or in the garage, but absolutely nothing inside.

About me:
I'm not a neat freak, but I am clean. I like my place to stay clean whenever possible.
I have a potty-trained and well-mannered pomsky on site - he is not allowed in the tenant's room. He does not bark or howl.
If I have an issue, I voice my opinion and compromise on resolutions. I respect tenants who voice their opinions as well. I tend to get along with everyone, so this is simply a disclosure.

Expectations:
Noise should be kept to a moderate level. I do not mind guests, so long as the neighbors do not complain.
This is my home as well as yours - please keep it clean and classy!
Communicate.
No hard drugs. I do not mind if you smoke outside or in the garage, but absolutely nothing inside.

Have all appliances, and washer and dryer. I will also supply laundry detergent, fabric softener, and dryer sheets. Shared bathroom, but I'm very clean and keep everything clean always! Or you could have the entire basement to yourself. Has cable hookup, and shower in it, but no sink or toilet. It's not a brand new or perfect house, has its flaws, but very livable and cozy. I'm slowly working on improving it, and if you're willing to help then that's even better! Mainly just needs painted inside in every room. Which I almost have done now. I'm looking for $600 a month. That sounds like a lot, but it's really not considering it's a shared house, not just limited to one room, and that is everything included; rent, all utilities, power, heat, ac, cable, etc... I can try to work with you though, so just get with me and we can figure something out. Message or text for any other details! Please give info about yourself when you reply, like age, whether you have a job, vehicle, and can split cost, etc, and please send a picture so I know you're real and serious!

Each occupant is on a separate rental agreement. The common rooms are a living room, kitchen, laundry room, bathroom, half bathroom, and a utility room with a washer and dryer for use by occupants. Renter's insurance is included in the price. Utilities are paid by the landlord, including Internet access. If interested, ask about the option to use the Ethernet. Parking is available on the street as well as in back. Pets are generally not allowed (example of a possible exception is for fish kept in the half bathroom in a small container). Smoking and vaping of any sort are not allowed. Selected occupant must be neat, pass the screening process (including financial, and criminal and civil courts), be responsible, quiet and get along with others. The landlord, a futurist / environmentalist lives next door, and a techie/student, and factory worker live there. Gardeners, neighborly people, bicyclists, commuters by bus, people who like to live near Downtown, nonsmokers, and ecological minded people might especially appreciate this location. By the way, I know of landlords who rent bedrooms, studios, apartments and houses. Currently (01/27/2019) I know of bedrooms and a one bedroom apartment ($650) for rent.

I have been renting out rooms in my home for many years now. I have rented to professionals, traveling nurses, students and even international students attending school at ELS, IUPUI and University of Indianapolis from places such as India, Saudi Arabia, China, Japan and Turkey. Renting my rooms has provided some great experiences in meeting new people and making new friends. There are two rooms for rent and are fully furnished (queen size bed, TV, dresser, desk, closet, high speed wireless internet w/ high speed ethernet cord in room as well, and your own DVR satellite for TV) and the use of a Jacuzzi hot tub. The rent covers everything, no hidden costs. I am looking for a clean, responsible and drama-free roommate who pays rent on time and cleans up after themselves. My home is a clean, quiet and a place to relax from a hard day's work. My neighborhood and home is located directly next to a Kroger grocery store and strip mall that includes various restaurants, a Planet Fitness if you like to work out as I do with LA Fitness being about 5 minutes from my house. I also have a Walmart/Loews within a one minute drive from my house. If you are a student, IUPUI is close only being a 12 minute drive from my house, University of Indianapolis is only a 5 minute drive from my house and ELS language center is only about 12 minute drive from my house and downtown Indianapolis about a 12 minute drive. There is also Indy Go bus line that is located across the street that is accessible to you. Whether you're a professional or student, my home is perfect for you and is travel friendly to any destination being 2 minutes from I-465 interstate. My home is clean and pet free(no animals please), smoking is done outside. I am looking for someone who can, at minimum, commit to a 6 month agreement. The room for rent is for ONE person, not married couples or for a boyfriend/girlfriend or children to live in. If you are interested or have any questions, please feel free to contact me at show contact info. The rooms are on a first come, first serve basis and will be available to rent on March 24th, 2019.
